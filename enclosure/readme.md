Comments: <br>
	1) pcb_supports, pads power supply support  were glued to the case with CA300 and activator<br>
	2) pcbs, covers, pads were screwed to the case<br>
	3) due to small print bed of my printer (220x220cm) I had to divide covers and base of amplifier and receiver into 4 parts, printing took 120 hours for all components and I used ca. 2kg of Impact PLA.<br>
	4) printed with front face and back face of reciever/amplifier on printer's bed to hide print layers.<br>
	5) To hide layering I additionally sanded the cases and used primer, car filler, spray paint (see photo).<br>
